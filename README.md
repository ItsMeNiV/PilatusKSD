PilatusKSD
==========

A small program, which reads Data from a website and saves them to a Database.
Used for a challenge of a local radiostation. They said they won't play a song 2 times a day. This Program reads the Songname and Artistname from the website and saves it to a Database.
Later it will check the Database for twins.
